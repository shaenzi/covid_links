## anti-coagulation
- [preprint on triple anti-coagulant therapy](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2697680/v1) small study; all LC patients with microclots, seems helpful (but pretty strong potential side effects?)

## Vaccination or re-infection?
[Reinfection worsens LC](https://www.longcovidkids.org/post/a-world-first-effect-of-covid-reinfection-on-people-living-with-long-covid) survey of patients
- self-selection...
- vast majority not vaccinated before first infection
- re-infection makes LC worse (80% worse, 10% better)
- vaccination effect is mixed, mostly no change, more worse than better

Papers on effect of vaccination on LC
- [nr 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/5/652)
- [nr 2](https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj-2021-069676)
- [nr 3](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.20.22276621v1)
- [nr 4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.27689)
- [nr 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8366804.1/)
- in general mixed but more worse than better

i.e. both vaccination and reinfection are pretty bad with Long Covid (though reinfection probably worse?)
