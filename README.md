## Vaccination or re-infection?
[Reinfection worsens LC](https://www.longcovidkids.org/post/a-world-first-effect-of-covid-reinfection-on-people-living-with-long-covid) survey of patients
- self-selection...
- vast majority not vaccinated before first infection
- re-infection makes LC worse (80% worse, 10% better)
- vaccination effect is mixed, mostly no change, more worse than better
